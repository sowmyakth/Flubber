# Flubber
An attempt to deduce the probability distribution of galaxy shapes (|e|).  
Procedure
- create shape distributions (from existing catalogs which contain shear signal)
- Draw samples from this distribution appply shear and noise $$\sigma $$ to get observed shape
- Now Calculate the hyperparameters to get the actual shape distribution 
- PGM looks like:
